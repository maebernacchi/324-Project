# 324-Project
324 Individual project

Hours Dedicated to Project: 9 Hours

Questions I want to ask on 10/2:
1. For a scatterplot should I use a slider, or give users the option to choose a sectionn of the x axis to examine?
2. Should I add in a line of best fit on each graph as a default or should I give the user an option to add it?
3. I'm currently thinking about putting all four of my graphs next to each other, the two for 4th grade on top and the 2 for 8th grade on bottom. Should I do this, or separate them based on the grade level so 4th and 8th grade are in two separate spots?
4. Should I have one slider and one multiple-choice option for each graph, or should I separate them by grade?
